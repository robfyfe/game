- ngView works with the $route service to inject the view based on what the route provider determines should be viewed.
- is it correct when I added the models to manually add the file include into the index.html?
- can we use some form of modularisation to add classes into to ensure there are no naming clashes?
- add closure to make the objects more secure so they do not expose their internals?  Like, Yahtzee with scoresheet and dice, should only be accessible via methods
- Do I need "this" on functions in yahtzee?  Can they just be defined with var?  this.dice vs var dice
